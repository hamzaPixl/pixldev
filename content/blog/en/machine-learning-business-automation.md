    similar_users = find_similar_users(user_id, user_behavior_matrix)
    recommendations = generate_recommendations(similar_users, similarity_threshold)
    return recommendations.sort_by_confidence()

# Real-time personalization
customer_segments = ml_model.predict_segment(user_data)
personalized_experience = customize_interface(customer_segments)
```

```sql
-- ML-powered credit scoring model
WITH customer_features AS (
  SELECT
    customer_id,
    credit_history_score,
    income_stability_index,
    debt_to_income_ratio,
    behavioral_patterns
  FROM customer_analytics
),
risk_predictions AS (
  SELECT
    customer_id,
    ML.PREDICT(credit_risk_model, customer_features.*) as risk_score
  FROM customer_features
)
SELECT * FROM risk_predictions WHERE risk_score < 0.3; -- Low risk customers
```
